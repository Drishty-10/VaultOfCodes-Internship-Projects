📚 Projects

Project 1 (Personal Portfolio Website) : The objective of this project is to apply the knowledge you have gained about HTML,
the basic structure of a webpage, and creating headings, paragraphs, lists, and links to create a personal portfolio website

Project 2 : This project is a creative transformation of a simple web page into something visually stunning and engaging. With a strong focus on aesthetic design and user appeal, it demonstrates how creativity can enhance the look and feel of a webpage using only HTML and CSS. The goal was simple: to make the page more attractive and stunning — and this project delivers exactly that with style and clarity.

Project 3 (VaultOfCodes Mini Project): This project is a single-page interactive recipe card made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a recipe with a title, image, ingredients, steps, preparation time, and serving size. Users can click buttons to show or hide ingredients and steps, and use a “Start Cooking” and “Next” button to highlight each step one by one. CSS animations and transitions make the card visually engaging with hover effects and smooth content changes. The layout is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Bonus features include a timer that starts when cooking begins and a print option for the recipe.

Project 4 (VaultOfCodes Final Project) : This is a clean and responsive To-Do List web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users add, complete, and delete tasks easily, saving them permanently using Local Storage. Perfect for managing daily goals with a minimal and beautiful design.
