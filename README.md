📚 Projects
Project Name : Personal Portfolio Website
Project 1 : The objective of this project is to apply the knowledge you have gained about HTML,
the basic structure of a webpage, and creating headings, paragraphs, lists, and links to create a
personal portfolio website

project 2 : This project is a creative transformation of a simple web page into something visually stunning and engaging. With a strong focus on aesthetic design and user appeal, it demonstrates how creativity can enhance the look and feel of a webpage using only HTML and CSS. The goal was simple: to make the page more attractive and stunning — and this project delivers exactly that with style and clarity.
